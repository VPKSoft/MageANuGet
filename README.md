# MageANuGet
A very simple and limited NuGet creation software.

## Features
* Supports the new SPDX license with the nuget packages. The support is however limited limited with OR expressions only.
* Generates a .nuspec file, generates NuGet packages and can push them to the nuget.org.
* Support for embedded file license.

## Compiling from source
* You will need a Visual Studio Community 2017 edition (+) and the [nuget.exe](https://www.nuget.org/downloads) placed on the project directory.

## Contributing
Please do contribute if you wish to add new features - the existing feature set is enough for me.
